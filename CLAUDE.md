# CLAUDE.md

Auto-loaded context for Claude Code. Read this first, then `docs/context.md` for the
compaction-safe session state and `docs/handoff.md` for the running log.

## What this is

**Aether One X v2** — a scroll-driven 3D product film site for a **fictional** flagship
phone. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 8 + Tailwind v4 + three/R3F. The homepage is one
continuous camera shot across 11 acts driven by a single `scrollYProgress` MotionValue.

Two repos, and they are not the same thing:

- **Build repo** (this one): `C:\Users\Aaron\aether-one-x-v2`, git `master`.
- **Deploy repo**: `C:\Users\Aaron\Documents\GitHub\muse-spark-testing`, git `main`,
  GitHub `derprito64bit/muse-spark-testing`, Vercel Hobby auto-deploys.

**Sync ritual:** work in the build repo, then copy across excluding `.git`,
`node_modules`, `dist`, `reference`, `test-results`, `playwright-report`,
`.playwright-mcp`. Commit both. Push deploy.

---

## Commands

Windows PowerShell. The `.ps1` shims are blocked by execution policy, so **always use
`npm.cmd` and `npx.cmd`.**

```
npm.cmd run dev        vite, port 5173
npm.cmd run verify     typecheck + lint + format + test + build + analyze
npm.cmd run e2e:quick  chromium smoke + film (local loop)
npm.cmd run e2e        full matrix (prefer CI)
node scripts/m3r-shots.mjs      9 device views (primary visual check)
node scripts/capture-film.mjs   act snapshots into docs/film-snaps/
```

`npm run verify` must be green before any milestone is called done. Always `build`
before `e2e`.

## DESIGN AUTHORITY — read this before touching the camera

**The camera module is CIRCULAR.** Verified in `src/components/PhoneViewer/phoneDimensions.ts`:
`MODULE`, `COLLAR`, `LENS_RING_R = 0.0102`, `LENSES`, `PERISCOPE`, `TOF`, `MEDALLION`,
`MODULE_MIC`. There is no `ISLAND` constant. The offset two-tier plateau is gone.

**`docs/handoff.md` decision D7 is STALE.** It says the dial/circular camera was retired
in favour of the plateau. That was true on 2026-09-20 and was reversed when the circular
module spec landed. The same applies to the "Prompt authority" paragraph near the top of
`docs/context.md`. The "Dimensions" section further down that same file is correct.

**When docs and code disagree, the code wins.** Check `phoneDimensions.ts` and
`src/film/timeline.ts` first, then fix the stale doc in the same commit.

Current module: centred at `(0, 0.0458)`, `outerR 0.0235`, double-step collar, three
round lenses on a triangle at polar `R = 0.0102` (main `r.0060 @90°`, ultra `r.0049 @210°`,
mid `r.0049 @330°`), rectangular periscope below, arc flash, ToF emitter/receiver pair,
module mic, six-blade iris medallion inlaid under the cover glass, knurled collar.
`BODY_N = 6.0`.

## Timeline

Eleven acts. `xray`, `chip`, and `rebuild` were replaced by a single `teardown` act
occupying the same span, so no downstream boundary moved.

```
arrival 0–0.10   settle 0.10–0.155   approach 0.155–0.25
teardown 0.25–0.52        <- the horizontal layer-by-layer sequence
camera 0.52–0.72   display 0.72–0.84   storage 0.84–0.89
battery 0.89–0.93  software 0.93–0.95  ai 0.95–0.975  final 0.975–1
```

Teardown has ten layers in physical stack order, front to back: `cover-glass`, `display`,
`midframe`, `battery`, `logic-board`, `silicon`, `thermal`, `power-coil`, `camera`,
`rear-panel`. The battery sits in front of the logic board; that is correct, not a bug.

Pacing is controlled by `--film-height` in `src/index.css`, **not** by moving act
boundaries. Every boundary is a fraction, so changing the runway rescales everything
without touching the timeline.

---

## Architecture

```
src/lib/          pure math, no React, no three. All unit tested.
                  superellipse, battery, progress (branded 0..1), format
src/film/         the homepage film
  key.ts          FilmKey authoring API + smoothstep
  timeline.ts     ACTS + composed KEYS
  acts/*.ts       one file per act, object-literal keyframes
  sample.ts       zero-alloc sampler, re-clocked Catmull-Rom
  framing.ts      fit-based responsive FOV solver
  states.ts       computeFilmStates(p) -> scratch object of scalars
  shots.ts        per-act shot profile + velocity caps
  lighting.ts     per-act studio state + stage colour
  FilmDirector    the single useFrame that writes everything
  stage/          cyclorama, floor, stageColors
  teardown/       layers.ts manifest
  internals/      layout.ts (component manifest), explode.ts (registry),
                  parts/ (board, silicon, power, optics)
  overlay/        chapters copy, primitives, Callouts
src/components/PhoneViewer/   the device: dimensions, geometry, materials,
                  textures, finishes, environment, CameraAssembly
src/zoom/         zoom module math
```

## Invariants — do not violate

1. **Everything in the film is a pure function of scroll progress.** No time-based
   animation, or scrubbing backward desyncs. Screw rotation is `explode × 2π`, never an
   accumulating angle.
2. **Scroll values never enter React state.** MotionValues and refs only. No
   `window.addEventListener('scroll')` anywhere.
3. **Zero allocation in `useFrame`.** Reuse scratch objects. `computeFilmStates` returns
   one shared object by design.
4. **Materials are transparent from birth** so the dissolve never triggers a mid-film
   shader recompile.
5. **Dispose everything.** If you add a map slot (`normalMap`, `anisotropyMap`,
   `clearcoatNormalMap`, `sheenColorMap`), extend the disposal walk in the same commit.
6. **No drei imports in app code.** 900KB of lazy bloat. Custom geometry instead (D3).
7. **Motion, not GSAP.** Single animation runtime (D1). The GSAP MCP is installed and
   deliberately unused.
8. **The device is fictional.** No real manufacturer's wordmark, logo, letterform, or
   product design. The optics partner and its medallion are original. This is a merge
   gate, see `docs/device-originality.md`.
9. **Zero third-party runtime requests.** Enforced by `src/lib/no-network.test.ts`.

## Landmines

Full list in `docs/context.md`. The ones that cost the most time:

- **`SHELL_MATS` / `FRAME_MATS` in `FilmDirector.tsx`.** Every new device material key
  must be added or the part stays solid through the teardown. The inverse also bites: the
  subpixel macro overlay was in `SHELL_MATS` and got pinned opaque, washing every face
  grey. That was the single biggest visual bug of the project.
- **Earcut drops dense holes in superellipse extrudes.** The ring is an explicit annulus.
  `ringHole.test.ts` guards it. Annulus loops must start at `+X` with monotone winding or
  the lid pinwheels.
- **R3F `aria-label` on `<group>` throws on re-render.** Use `name`.
- **Parallax must not accumulate inside the damped aim.** Apply it at `lookAt`.
- **`?t=` captures land short** because of layout shift. `m3r-shots.mjs` re-scrolls after
  settle. Multi-viewer pages poison `window.__` probes.
- **Axe must run after entrance motion settles** (600ms) plus `fonts.ready`.
- **CLS tests:** no `buffered: true`; wait for the lazy chunk and fonts first.
- **`react` / `react-dom` pinned to exactly 19.2.8.** Fiber caps below 19.3.
- **Vite 8 uses `build.rolldownOptions.output.advancedChunks`.** The `rollupOptions` alias
  is silently ignored (D2).
- **PowerShell:** no heredocs, no `||`, and `>` corrupts binaries as UTF-16. Never use the
  shell for file operations; use the file tools.
- **Live module probes (round 03 Part 0).** The dev server serves native ESM: import
  app modules directly in the browser console and measure, don't infer. Set
  `scroll-behavior: auto` first (smooth swallows scripted jumps),
  `window.__scene` is poisoned on multi-canvas pages (configurator owns it —
  find the hero group by non-1 scale instead), `import('three')` fails (bare
  specifier — import app modules), and never import with `?t=` cache-busters
  (forks the HMR graph and poisons the tab with phantom errors).

---

## Verification

1. `npm.cmd run verify`.
2. `node scripts/m3r-shots.mjs` for the 9 device views.
3. **The reverse scrub.** Drag from 1.0 back to 0.0 slowly. Nothing pops, no part
   teleports. This catches more than every other check combined.
4. **Grayscale test** for any material work: force albedo to mid-grey. If the subject
   flattens, the lighting is doing no work and materials will not rescue it.
5. Re-capture snapshots and review diffs by eye before committing them.

GPU here is an RTX 3070 with a Ryzen 5600X, so real traces are meaningful. SwiftShader
appears only in headless runs and gives lower bounds, not real numbers.

## Blender

Live link via the `blender` MCP. Blender 4.5.14 LTS (Steam) + MCP-for-Blender addon v1.7,
protocol 9. Auto-start flag is saved in the .blend; if it does not reconnect, use the
N-panel, BlenderMCP tab, Start MCP Server.

Scene file: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\opencode\aether-one-x.blend`

Lessons that will otherwise cost an hour each: 2D-curve slabs render uncapped, use a
bmesh loft; the body needs dark caps under the cover glass; a big flat-on area light blows
obsidian to white, so use dim raking light; bmesh has no `create_torus`, hand-roll a
parametric one; transmission glass over bright lights blows out, so darken the lens base;
`execute_blender_code` is stateless, redefine helpers every call.

---

## Moving from opencode to Claude Code

- **MCP servers already work.** `.mcp.json` carries chrome-devtools, playwright, context7,
  blender, and gsap. On first run they show "Pending approval" — run `claude` in the
  project and approve each. `opencode.json` can stay; it is ignored here.
- **The `dataviz` skill is NOT available to Claude Code yet.** It was installed for
  opencode at `~/.config/opencode/skills/dataviz/`. Copy that folder to
  `.claude/skills/dataviz/` in this repo so it is version-controlled and loads here. Load
  it before writing any chart, meter, or KPI code.
- **Context7 resolves drei as `/pmndrs/drei`**, not the npm package name.
- Prompt specs live in `docs/`: `meta-prompt-main.md`, `m3r-device-model.md`,
  `prompt-a-fidelity.md`, `prompt-b-animation.md`, plus the newer circular-module,
  internals, and teardown briefs in `Claude outputs/`.

---

## Honest gaps

Real-GPU traces still outstanding. Reduced-motion e2e coverage is thin. Rack-focus DOF is
deferred pending measurement (`focusPull` and `macroAtmos` are wired to accent and sensor
shimmer as the no-DOF path). `sectionCut` is reserved and unused. Callouts show only one
or two labels at a time by the collision rule. LOD2 and the merged shell are deferred with
reasons recorded in `docs/device-design.md`. Lighthouse CI runs in CI but has not been
exercised locally.
